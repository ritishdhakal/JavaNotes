Encapsulation is the process of binding data members and methods together into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to some of the object's components to provide security.

Main goal: Data security and controlled access

Achieved using access modifiers (usually private) and getter/setter methods

 Example
class Customer {
    private int age; // data member is private

    // Setter method to control access
    void setAge(int a) {
        if (a >= 18 && a <= 60)
            age = a;
        else
            System.out.println("Invalid Age");
    }

    // Optional: getter method
    int getAge() {
        return age;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Customer c = new Customer();

        c.age = -20;       //  error: age is private
        c.setAge(30);      //  allowed
        System.out.println(c.getAge()); // prints: 30
    }
}

 Key Points

Data members should be private

Methods should be public to provide controlled access

Use setter methods to validate data before assigning

Use getter methods to read data


Full Encapsulation

A class is fully encapsulated when all its data members are private and accessed only through getter/setter methods.
