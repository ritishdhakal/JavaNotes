Abstract is used to define rules / specifications.
It tells what a class must have, but not how it works.

Abstract Method

A method which is declared but not defined is called an abstract method

It ends with ;
Example :

abstract void yyy();

.................................

Abstract method has no body

So we cannot write code inside it

Its main purpose is to force child classes to implement it

.....................

Abstract Class

A class declared using abstract keyword is called abstract class

An abstract class can have: Zero or more abstract methods

Normal methods also

abstract class Sample {
    abstract void yyy();
}
..........................

Important Rule

If a class extends an abstract class, then:

It must override all abstract methods

Otherwise the child class must also be declared abstract

Example:

class Sample1 extends Sample {
    void yyy() {
        // implementation
    }
}


If we don’t want to override:

abstract class Sample2 extends Sample {
    void aaa() {}
}

Why we cannot create object of abstract class?

Because Abstract class is incomplete

Abstract methods do not have implementation

Java does not know what code to execute


Sample s = new Sample(); // error


Real life example:

Abstract class = blueprint of car

Object = real car

Blueprint cannot be driven

Reference of Abstract Class

We cannot create object of abstract class

But we can create reference of abstract class

Sample s = new Sample1();

.....................................
Here object is of child class

Child class has implementation

So it works
...........................

What happens when abstract method is called?

JVM checks the object

Calls the overridden method in child class

Abstract method only defines the rule


......................

Key Points to Remember

Abstract method → no body

Abstract class → no object

Child class must implement abstract methods

Abstract is used to enforce compulsory behavior





Simple line to remember

Abstract method = what is required
Child class = how it is done

Programme :

abstract class Vehicle
{
abstract void drive();
void applyBreak()
System.out.println("Applying Break");
}
class Car extends Vehicle
void drive ()
{
System.out.println("Driving a Car");
}
void changeGear ()
{
System.out.println("Chaning Gear");
}
}
public class AbstractDemo {
public static void main (Stringll args) {
//Vehicle v = new Vehicle();//error   we cannot create object of abstract class
Vehicle v = new Car();
v.drive();
v. applyBreak();
//v. changeGear;//error since vehicle can only invoke the overridden method and it's own
Car c = new Car;
c. changeGear () ;
