Interfaces
----------
- It is used to form the rules/specifications
- Does not force "is-a" relationship
- In an interface all data members are public, static and final by default
- In an interface all methods are public and abstract by default
	Ex:
		interface I1
		{
		   [public static final] int MAX = 100;
		   [public abstract] void xxx();
		   [public abstract] void yyy();
		}

		[] => by default/implicit/optional

- If a class implements an interface then we need to override all abstract methods
  else make the class as abstract
	Ex:
		class C1 implements I1
		{
		   void xxx(){...}
		   void yyy(){...}
		}


- We cannot create objects for interfaces but we can create references referring to 
  the subclass object
	Ex:
		I1 i = new I1();//error
		I1 i1 = new C1();//valid

- A class can implement multiple interfaces
	Ex:
		interface I2
		{
		   void zzz();
		}
		class C2 implements I1, I2
		{
		   void xxx(){...}
		   void yyy(){...}
		   void zzz(){...}
		}

- class to class => extends
  class to interface => implements
  interface to interface => extends
	Ex:
		interface I3 extends I1 {}
  interface to class => error

- An interface can extend multiple interfaces
	Ex:
		interface I4 extends I1, I2 {..}
	
Note
----
- From Java 8 version we can defined methods in interfaces using default keyword
- From Java 8 version we can define static methods in interfaces
- From Java 9 version we can define private methods in interfaces

	Refer program InterfaceDemo.java

Note
----
abstract and final are illegal combination of modifiers

Ex:
	abstract final class Base {} //error - abstract and final are illegal combination of modifiers (WHY???)

Why are they illegal together? (LOGIC)
abstract

Means incomplete

Must be overridden by child classes

final

Means cannot be overridden

Cannot be changed or extended

 They contradict each other.

Example Programme (InterfaceDemo.java)



interface shape {
    void draw();

    default void fill() {
        System.out.println("It is filled with colors");

    }
}

class Circle implements shape {
    public void draw() {
        System.out.println("It is drawn");
    }
}

public class InterfaceDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        shape s1 = new Circle();
        s1.draw();
        s1.fill();
    }
}
