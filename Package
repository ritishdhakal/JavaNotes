Packages
--------
- A package is a collection of related classes (.class files)
- package keyword is used to create a package
	Ex:
		package mypack;

- package statement should be the first statement in the source code file
	Ex:
		MyClass.java
		-------------
		package mypack;
		import ...
		import *  where * is every classes under the package
		class MyClass1
		{}
		class MyClass2
		{}

- In a source code file we can have only one package statement with multiple import statements
  and multiple class definitions
- The classes under the package are stored in a folder whose name is same as the package name
- Only public classes are accessible outside the package
- To use the classes of one package into another package we need to import the package
	Ex:
		import mypack.MyClass1;
		import mypack.MyClass2;
			or
		import mypack.*;//* indicates all classes under the package


if we have package com.oop.java then com is the outer package where as oop is inside com and java is inside oop 
exmple java.util.Scanner;
